					<h4>Free Pick of 7/10</h4>
					<p id="TodaysPick">Red Sox vs. White Sox</p>
					<p> Under 8 </p>

				<div class="column2"><p id="reason">This pitcher has been on fire! Santos has already faced 3 of top offensive teams and has won each game with an impressive ERA of .98! Coming in after a 5 day rest period, there isn't any is no other pick I would rather take. The only nuance in with todays pick is that Cubs have one very impressive batter. Darvish has been able to hit odd balls every now and then, but that aside the team has not found a rythem as a whole in the last two series.</p>
